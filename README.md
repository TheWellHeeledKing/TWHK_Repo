rgb_controller

With the help of ChatGPT, I am developing a python application to allow me to control, with a single click, the RGB lighting on the diverse devices of my gaming/streaming set-up. The application is to be as generic as possible, multi-language enabled and open-source. It uses the OpenRGB API (https://github.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB).
