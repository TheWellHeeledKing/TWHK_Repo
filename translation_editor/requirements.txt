1. Application Purpose:

    The goal is to create a translation editor for managing translation files, allowing editing of content while supporting filtering and sorting for easy navigation.
    The application should be dynamic and easy to use for adding, editing, and deleting translations.

2. Core Features:

    Translation File Management:
        The app should allow opening, viewing, and saving translation files in CSV format (or potentially other formats in the future).
        Rows represent individual translation entries, and columns correspond to different language versions.

    Dynamic Editing:
        The table should be editable directly by the user. Changes made in the table should be reflected in the underlying data model immediately.
        The user should be able to edit the translation entries easily in-place (text editing of cells).

    Filtering:
        Filters should be available for column data, enabling the user to filter rows based on their content.
        The current filtering logic (which is complex and carefully designed) should be maintained when switching to tkintertable, ensuring the filters can still work dynamically with the table.
        Filters should be accessible and configurable, with multi-column filtering and the ability to clear filters.

    Sorting:
        Sorting of the columns should be supported, so the user can click on a column header to sort translations alphabetically (ascending/descending).

3. Table Design:

    Dynamic Table (tkintertable):
        The table should use tkintertable for dynamic editing of content, replacing ttk widgets.
        It must support editable cells, where each row represents a translation entry, and users can directly input or edit the content.
        Data validation (if needed) should be incorporated into the table to prevent invalid inputs.

    Table Structure:
        The table should display multiple columns for different language versions and possibly include columns for other data points (e.g., context, comments).
        The user should be able to resize columns as needed to accommodate text.

4. UI Components:

    Filters UI:
        Filters should be displayed in a separate filter section (either above or beside the table), with input fields for text-based filters or dropdowns for category-based filtering.
        The user should be able to select and modify multiple filters at the same time and clear filters when needed.

    Buttons and Navigation:
        Buttons should be clearly labeled for actions like open, save, and filter reset.
        The application should support basic keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl + S for saving, Ctrl + O for opening a file).

5. Data Integrity:

    Any changes made to the table should be immediately reflected in the underlying data model (e.g., the dictionary or DataFrame representing the translations).
    The system should prevent any loss of data if there’s an issue (e.g., if a user forgets to save their changes before closing the app).

6. Performance Considerations:

    The app should be responsive even with large translation files.
    Filtering, sorting, and editing should not cause noticeable lag for the user.

7. Error Handling:

    Errors, such as invalid data input or file loading issues, should be properly caught and displayed to the user in a clear and user-friendly way (e.g., through pop-up error messages).
    The app should handle cases where a file is not loaded or saved correctly.

8. Additional Considerations:

    The UI should be consistent with other Python Tkinter-based applications (e.g., using ttk for consistent styling).
    Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux/Mac) should be ensured, with no reliance on external dependencies that could break the app across platforms.

Refinements Based on Code Review:

From the current implementation, here's what I’ve refined and ensured for the app’s functionality:

    Filters Logic:
        Filters should still allow multi-column filtering.
        The filtering logic must be preserved as is from the current working state. The main goal is to integrate this logic within the tkintertable framework without altering its functionality.

    Dynamic Editing:
        Ensure that the user can directly edit the content of each cell in the table (with any data entry validated before accepting the change).
        The current design allows direct editing of text for translation entries, so this must be carried over.

    Data Model Integration:
        The underlying data model (likely a dictionary or a DataFrame) should continue to store the translations.
        Changes made in the table should update the model automatically to reflect any edits, deletions, or additions.

Next Steps:
